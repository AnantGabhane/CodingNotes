Time complexity
- You can have N values in array
- A = [ 1,2,3 ]
- B = [1, 4, 9]
- def square(arr) : -> looping will in o(N) time
----
Space complexity
- space taken by memory to store result 
- No extra space - 0(1)
---
0(1) constant time operations 
- Hashing 
- Array indexing - array at particular position
