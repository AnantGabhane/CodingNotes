## Components / essentials of Traditional AI Solutions

A. ML Pipeline

B. Compute Infrastructure

C. User Interface

### **A. ML Pipeline - consists of**

#### 1. Data processing :
- Preparing and transforming raw data from machine learning 
- Tool used for data processing 
    - **Apache Spark** (used for big data processing)
    - **Pandas** (provides robust structure for efficient data manipulation and pre-processing)
    - **Apache Kafka** (distributed real time platform for real time data ingestion and processing, ensuring seamless data streaming for ML pipelines)


    - Data involved significantly impact performance and effectiveness of machine learning model
    -    Data processing steps :
        
         - Collections - gathering data through databases, API, files or scraping data from web 
         - Data cleaning and pre-processing :
                 
            - cleaning involves identifying data inconsistencies, errors and missing values in the data 
            - pre-processing involves formatting the data to make it suitable for model training. This helps in eliminating biaes, standardizing features and reduce the dimensionality of the data
    - Feature engineering - creating new features to capture relative patters and relationships between data

#### 2. Model Development :
- Using processed datasets to train machine learning models
- Data scientists design and build predictive models based on processed data
- Stage involves choosing right model architecture, training the model using labeled data and evaluating its performance
- Algorithmic selection :
    - choosing the right architecture or algorithm that aligs the best with problem. Depends om data type and nature of the problem
